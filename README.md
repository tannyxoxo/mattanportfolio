Hello! I Am a 14 year old high school student, and I really enjoy singing, reading and writing. I currently attend a branch of SAMOHI called Personalized Project Based Learning Pathway (PPBL). Currently I am developing a TV series and reading up on poetry. I am witty and passionate about everything, especially books.
